1.
To get how much disk space is used to represent ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L I 
cd into the directory. Then I ran 'du' command on that directory, and the Git 
repository. I used -sh option for the current directory for readability.

$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L 
$ du -sh .
$ du -sh .git

The working directory consumes 509M and the Git repository consumes 350M. The 
file that consumes the most in the Git repository is ./git/objects/pack because
it contains all the compressed files from all the different commits.

2.
I got the number of local and remote branches to the repository with git branch
command. Since origin/HEAD is not a branch, I subtracted one.

Remote branches: 176
$ git branch -r | wc -l

Local branches: 176
$ git branch | wc -l

3.
There is only one remote repository and it is origin. It is located in 
refs/remotes/

Commands:
$ git remote
$ find -d -name origin

4.
To get the 10 local branches most recently committed to, I used for-each-ref
command. Then I sorrted by commit date from refs/heads/ since I want only
local branches. Lastly I added a count argument.

Command:
$ git for-each-ref --sort=committerdate refs/heads/ --count=10

5.
To get the number of commits in the master branch, I ran rev-list.

Command:
$ git rev-list --count master
139583


6.
I got the percentage of commits in any branch also in master branch. I got the
total number of commits and compared to the result from the last step.

Command:
$ git rev-list --all --count
143910

139583/143910 = 97.0% commits are also in master branch


7.
I used shortlog to get the 10 most authored people since 2013. The command 
includes the number of commits as well.

Command:
$ git shortlog -s -n --since="2013"

  3627  Eli Zaretskii
  3519  Paul Eggert
  3424  Glenn Morris
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1725  Stefan Monnier
  1511  Michael Albinus
   611  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky
   464  Alan Mackenzie
   455  Juri Linkov


8.
I opened up XQuartz, and then logged onto seasnet with the less secure ssh -X.
Then I used the gitk command to visualize the git structure.

Commands:
$ ssh -X markn@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
$ gitk
