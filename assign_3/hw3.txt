Q1.
The patch should marginally improve performance since it removed one if 
statement:
-          if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
-            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
+          ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
           break;

There is one less check the program has to make.
The patch also does the 'right' behavior when it comes to the order of the ls 
arguments, so it performs better in that respect.

Q2.
People will have to watch for the order that they enter -a and -A now.
Before it didn't matter what order you entered -a -A, but the new version of 
Coreutils now accounts for that.

Q3.
When randline.py is invoked on an empty file, it throws the error:
     IndexError: list index out of range.
In the code, when it calls the 'choice' function in line 34, it invokes a line,
   return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
which raises an IndexError when seq is empty.

Q4.
When randline.py is run under python3, it gives a SyntaxError on line 65.
The line is,
    except IOError as (errno, strerror)
which is an error message containing a tuple of the error number and error 
string. 
Python3 does not support error statements containing a tuple, leading to a 
syntax error.

Q5.
When I run shuf.py under Python 2, there are no errors because all of the
functions used in shuf.py are forward compatible to Python3.
Even the program was coded in Python 3, all the functions and syntax are 
valid under Python 2.
