1.
man -k [specific word]

First I used 'man man' to find the argument needed to print all commands with a specific word in their man page.
Then I tested 'man -k' a few times to make sure.
Commands:
man man
man -k list
man -k move


2.
mv: /usr/bin/mv  /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
sh: /usr/bin/sh

I used the whereis command to find where 'mv' and 'sh' are located
Commands:
whereis mv
whereis sh


3.
/usr/bin/pr
/usr/bin/ar
/usr/bin/tr

I searched the man page for 'find' to get a more specific search.
The '-executable' would only match with executable files, and to limit the name search, I can use '-name' paired with '?r'.
The '?' represents one character, the files we want have to end in 'r'.
Finally, I want to limit my search to the /usr/bin directory, so I can use that as the first arugment for find.
Commands:
man find
find /usr/bin -executable -name ?r


4.
/etc/alternatives/emacs

Since we knew that '/usr/bin/emacs' was a symbolic link, I used 'man -k' to find a command to trace the actual file.
Commands:
man -k symbolic link
man readlink
readlink /usr/bin/emacs


5.
plain gcc: gcc (GCC) 9.2.0
/usr/bin/gcc: gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)

The /usr/bin/gcc program has not been updated to the new version that the plain gcc is on.

To find the version, I knew the command was '--version'
Commands:
/usr/bin/gcc --version
/usr/local/cs/bin/gcc --version


6.
The user gains permissions to execute, while other loses permission to write/

I used the man pages of 'chmod' to understand the expression
Commands:
man chmod

I used the man pages of 'find' to find an argument that specifies the last time a file was changed.
The '-mtime -28' is used to locate files modified  less than 4 weeks ago.
'-type d' isolates the search to directories
Commmands:
man find
find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28


8.
280 symbolic links

To locate the directory of 'find', I used the 'whereis' command; it is in '/usr/bin'.
Then I could do a '-type' search using symbolic link type.
I then piped the command with 'wc -l' to count the number of new lines.
Commands:
man find
man wc
whereis find
find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l


9.
librom1394.so.0.3.0

I used the man pages for 'ls' to find the arguments needed to hone my search and include hidden files.
Commands:
man ls
ls /usr/lib64 -lta


10.
The locale command gets its data from environment variables.

I used the man pages for locale and locale(7) to find where locale gets its data from.
Commands:
man locale
man 7 locale


11.
downcase-region
downcase-word

I used the search command on emacs: C-h a
Commands:
C-h a  d o w n c a s e

12.
C-M-r: Do incremental search backward for regular expression.
C-M-s: Do incremental search forward for regular expression.
C-M-t: Interchange words around point, leaving point at end of them.
C-M-u: Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
C-M-v: Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.

Commands:
C-h k C-M-r
C-h k C-M-s
C-h k C-M-t
C-h k C-M-u
C-h k C-M-v

13.
The C-g command signals a `quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

Commands:
C-h k C-g


14.
The 'yank' command reinserts ("pastes") the last stretch of killed text.
It is invoked using: C-y

Commands:
C-h a yank


15.
The 'ls -l' command does not the two files, '.' and '..' when using Emacs 'dired' command. 
I performed both commands on /usr/bin, and compared the outputs.
To find the dired command, I used the emacs search command C-h a.

Commands:
ls -l /usr/bin
C-h a dired
C-x d
